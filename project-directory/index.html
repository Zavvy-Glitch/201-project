          Where does one begin when speaking about themselves? Do we start with heritage? Tradition? Familial origination? Personality traits?

          I could possibly go on eternally about myself and never actually know what to place down.

          So, lets start with my name and where I came from. My name is Tray Chea. I'm originally from St.Paul, Minnesota. The place where everyone uses the phrase 'ya sure, you betcha'. Kidding, I don't believe I've actually said the phrase myself. I am of Cambodian decent. My elders migrated from Cambodia to the United States in 1975 during the Pol Pot Khmer Rouge Regime.

          In the 45 years my grandparents had resided in the states, they hadn't spoken to anyone about their home land until I was 18 and asked for their stories. I'd suppose the memories of loss and tyranny are still hard to bare. Even then, they spoke of; an endless beauty, resilient peoples, and a fantastically rich religious history. In hearing these stories, they inspired me to travel to and see the country for myself.
